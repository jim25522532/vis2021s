1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,400
Almost heaven,

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,100
West Virginia

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,200
Blue Ridge Mountains

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,200
Shenandoah River

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,500
Life is old there,

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,100
older than the trees,

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,100
younger than the mountains

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
blowing like a breeze

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,700
country road

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,300
take me home

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,100
to the place

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,500
I belong

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,300
West Virginia

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,500
mountains mamma

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,220
take me home

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,300
country roads

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00 ,100
All my memories

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
gather round her,

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,600
miner's lady,

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,800
stranger to blue water

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,400
Dark and dusty,

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,680
painted on the sky 

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,500
misty taste of moonshine,

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,300
teardrop in my eye

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,500
country roads

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,300
I belong

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,400
West Virginia

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,700
mountain mamma

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,660

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,540
country roads

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,400
I hear her voice in the morning hour , she calls me

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,440
the radio reminds me of my home far away

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,800
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,400
yesterday , yesterday

37
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:14,800
